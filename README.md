# Covid 19 Data Analysis Using R Programming
Corona Virus may be diagnosed quickly and efficiently with effective COVID screening, by reducing the load on healthcare systems. 
These are intended to aid medical personnel across the globe in triaging patients, particularly in areas where healthcare resources are few. 

So from the data of the covid positive we have analysed and gained some effective knowledge and verified some prediction about it. 
COVID-19 was found in all of the people who were tested. 
The data in the test set came from the next week. sex, age years, and the location where it was most impacted, 
main features of this analysis is to get the needed information and prove some 
assumption on the covid 19 so from the data after we pre-process the data we have first taken the death rate and 
then we have to prove some assumption about the covid 19 that is the older people are most likely to die of covid than the younger once
